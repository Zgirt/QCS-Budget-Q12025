**Finance through CCF donations**

Qubic Core Services (QCS) is requesting funding from the Computor Control Fund (CCF) to fund running costs like overhead (salaries and expenses) and to fund basic activities for Marketing, Ecosystem Development, Community Management, Strategy, Finance and Operations. Basic activities include the funding of expanding the ecosystem team, hiring a new marketing lead, ads, growth marking software, PR (paid and earned media) market maker, ecosystem events, legal services and hiring. The budget overview includes a breakdown of the different workgroups and their budgeted expenditure. QCS did not request a budget for the month of January to reduce price pressure on the CCF. We are requesting $662.400 / 276bln qubics per 2400/bn to fund the running costs for the months February, March, April.

## Workgroups

All QCS workgroups work closely together to achieve the following three objectives: 

1. **Accelerate ecosystem growth for community, developers, users, and partners.**  
   
2. **Achieve position as the most innovative blockchain.**  

3. **Ensure Qubic's ecosystem financial health and long-term success.**

   

### Spending Transparency
The QCS spendings can be tracked here: [QCS Spending Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQfzfmqHJOxStRm6k6l9hrg21nFGdFj--ezKtmJ8AdU/edit?usp=sharing) and are broken down by workgroup.


### Ecosystem Development 
The Ecosystem Development team focuses on expanding the Qubic ecosystem through the development of grants programs, incubator program, crypto partnerships, events such as hackathons and institutional real-world partnerships. In Q3 and Q4, the Ecosystem team has onboarded close to 10 different projects onto the Qubic ecosystem, among them Vottun, Qubex and Nostromo that are creating wider user adoption. The team is also responsible for maintaining relationships with exchanges, listings, market makers, universities and institutions. The budget requested is to fund running costs, the new market maker, and to organize smaller events.

Additionally, the team will work to pave the way for the ecosystem to operate independently in a decentralized manner as quickly as possible.

Ecosystem is also a horizontal service that supports both the marketing and core tech teams. Likewise, Ecosystem requires collaboration from these two departments.

The **grants** and **incubation** programs already have their own funding, and this budget allocation will not expand these funds. Current expenses can be viewed in the following spreadsheets:<br>
	•	Grants: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvda8WZzVljbu6LKMxdTnNlt2Fj5T65xlH6FSOvO33k/edit?usp=sharing<br>
	•	Incubation: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ncuM_LT8HFMuD5D7FXHGrXITACNgD2W17FZqxygz58A/edit?usp=sharing<br>

Currently, they have a treasury, after deducting the payments for pending milestones once completed, of 58.3B and 148.5B for grants and incubation, respectively. This treasury is only used to pay for grants and incubation projects.
Ecosystem expenses are allocated for team salaries, a new market maker, events, scientific paper development, and associated costs for the mentioned operations. It is not included in the budget costs to list in exchanges. We plan to hire an Asian representative and also a PM.


### Marketing 
The Marketing team focuses on increasing the brand awareness and brand positioning of Qubic. It  develops a consistent brand voice and visual identity across all channels with the aim to establish Qubic as a thought leader in crypto and AI. The marketing team also focusses on community engagement and growth. It manages and expands Qubic’s online presence across all social platforms
Lastly the team manages content creation and distribution. It helps develop high quality content including blog posts, the Qubic whitepaper, virtual assets and manages the Qubic Academy. Other areas the team manages are growth marketing, KOL’s and paid advertising. 
Across all these areas we work closely with our ecosystem teams making sure they grow their presence and brands as well. 

In Q4 2024 the marketing team successfully launched various campaigns of which the “forget what you know” campaign in collaboration with Serotonin was most successful. The impact of Serotonin was substantial and the in-house marketing team learned a lot from them. Now the team is more than capable of launching growth marketing campaigns on our own and we canceled our collaboration with Serotonin. In Q4 we’ve seen a record growth in X followers from 68K to 107K, with the proportion of verified followers staying constant at 7% during this growth. Impressions have improved from an average of around 15K to well over 26K, with many now peaking at 50K We have employed a video editor and these posts mostly garner our biggest impressions of well over 50K Likes have also increased from a few hundred to well over 500 per post.We’ve also seen our Discord members grow from 43.8k to 57k members and Telegram from 9k to 19.5k followers.. 
In addition the marketing team has supported various ecosystem projects with their launches like QEarn, Vottun and Qubex.

The budget requested is to fund running costs, advertising, PR, sponsorships and software. We also request a budget to replace Foley who will leave Qubic and will be replaced by a paid Marketing Lead/CMO with relevant experience in crypto and web2.


### Community Management
The Community Management team moderates the Qubic Discord server and Telegram channel. It also relies on volunteers. Together with volunteers they are a total team of 20. The team ensures that both existing and new community members are welcomed, encourages conversations and makes sure community guidelines are followed.Furthermore there are engagement campaigns running on discord and telegram, like quizzes, game night, etc, with small prizes to win. The budget requested is to fund running costs and to fund these smaller mini games to keep community members engaged.



### Strategy, Operations, Finance 
The SFO team focuses on supporting the other workgroups and the ecosystem with strategy, operations and finance initiatives. In 2024 we successfully supported cross functional teams with growing the ecosystem, executing marketing campaigns, attracting talent, communication, PR, strategy and proving structure in daily operations.
In 2025 the team continues to drive the roadmap, objective key-results, helps accelerate key- projects, budgeting, HR, legal advisory and helps to operationally onboard new projects into the Qubic ecosystem. The requested budget covers running costs, 1 additional HC to help support the growing ecosystem, professionalized ecosystem support, operational costs, additional software and legal counsel.
